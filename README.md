## Originally intended for CSS golfing challenges in [CSSBattle](cssbattle.dev) but my skills are not to the par
###  As A Challenge to prepare myself for golfing and to broaden my css skills, i will randomly fiddle with concepts and CSS syntax and post it here.
-----------------------------------------------
For every 10 css fiddle completed. I will post a blog or create a video, regarding confusions and new concepts.
